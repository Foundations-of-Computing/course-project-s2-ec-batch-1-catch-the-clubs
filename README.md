Catch The Clubs

About the Project:

This is a dynamic and interactive web platform that helps college students discover, explore, and engage with various campus clubs. 

Features:

- 🎯 Club Discovery: Browse through various clubs based on your interests.
- 🔍 Search Functionality: Quickly find clubs using the search bar.
- 🎭 Filter by Category: View clubs based on different genres like **Technology, Music, Literature**, etc.
- 🌟 Club of the Day: Get a daily highlight of a featured club.
- 
How It Works:

1. Home Page (`main.html`)
   Displays a welcome section and a search bar.

2.  Filtering Clubs by Category
   Uses `genres.js` to fetch and display clubs from `clubs.json`.

3. Viewing Club Details
   Clicking on a club redirects to `club.html`, which shows more details.
